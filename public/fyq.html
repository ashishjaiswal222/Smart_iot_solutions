    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I control IoT devices remotely?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            You can control IoT devices remotely via a web interface. The devices are connected to the internet through Wi-Fi, and you can send commands from anywhere in the world using the control panel in the application.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the role of ESP32 in this project?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            ESP32 is used as the central microcontroller for connecting the IoT devices to the internet via Wi-Fi. It processes sensor data and sends it to the server for real-time monitoring.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the purpose of using Node.js for the backend?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            Node.js is used because of its asynchronous, event-driven nature, making it ideal for handling multiple device connections and real-time updates efficiently. It also integrates well with WebSockets for real-time communication.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does real-time data transfer work in this system?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            Real-time data is transferred through WebSockets using the "socket.io" library. When a device sends data (e.g., sensor readings), it is instantly transmitted to the client-side interface, allowing users to see live updates.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Which sensors are used in the smart plant system?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            The system uses various sensors, including soil moisture sensors to detect water levels, ultrasonic sensors for distance measurements, and temperature and humidity sensors to monitor environmental conditions.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I add more IoT devices to the system?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            You can add more devices by configuring new sensors or actuators with the ESP32 or Arduino. Once the hardware is set up, you need to add new device configurations to the backend and update the frontend to display the new devices.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the purpose of the water pump in the system?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            The water pump is used to automatically water plants when the soil moisture level falls below a predefined threshold. It is controlled remotely based on sensor readings and can be activated through the web interface.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is data stored and analyzed in this system?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            Data is stored on a server and can be accessed through the web interface. We use real-time data storage and analysis tools to track the health of plants, moisture levels, and environmental conditions, helping users make informed decisions.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What programming languages are used in this project?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            The project uses JavaScript (Node.js) for the backend and frontend logic, C++ for programming the Arduino, and HTML/CSS for the web interface. Additionally, libraries like "socket.io" and "express" are used for real-time communication.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I secure my IoT devices?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            IoT devices are secured using secure Wi-Fi encryption (WPA2) and SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission between the server and client. Additionally, authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized access.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I integrate this system with other IoT platforms?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes, the system can be integrated with other IoT platforms by implementing API endpoints to exchange data. For example, it can be connected to cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to enhance functionality and storage.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens if there is a power outage?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            If there's a power outage, the IoT devices may stop functioning temporarily. However, a battery backup or an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) can be added to the system to ensure continuous operation during power interruptions.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I monitor the performance of my IoT devices?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            You can monitor the performance of IoT devices in real-time through the web dashboard, which displays metrics like device status, sensor readings, and system alerts. You can also set up notifications for abnormal readings.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the benefits of using the ESP32 over other microcontrollers?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            The ESP32 offers built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it ideal for IoT projects. It is also powerful, energy-efficient, and has plenty of I/O options, which makes it highly versatile compared to other microcontrollers like Arduino.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I troubleshoot if a device stops working?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
            Troubleshooting involves checking the device's connection (Wi-Fi or power), verifying sensor functionality, reviewing logs for errors, and making sure that the backend server is correctly receiving and processing data from the device.
        </div>
